iputils (3:20150815-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  As of 3:20150815-1, the ping and ping6 commands are unified in a single
  binary that can communicate with targets of either address family. In 
  order to force the use of a specific address family, you need to either 
  pass the argument -4 or -6 on the command line, or call the program via 
  one of the ping4 or ping6 names.

  You will need to be particularly aware of this change if you're invoking ping
  via a script as part of a monitoring or other such automated system.
