 POSIX \fBbc\fR requires the opening brace on the same line as the 
 \fBdefine\fR key word and the \fBauto\fR statement on the next line.

 POSIX \fBbc\fR does not require these "old style" assignment operators to
 be defined.  This version may allow these "old style" assignments.  Use
 the limits statement to see if the installed version supports them.  If
 it does support the "old style" assignment operators, the statement
-"a =- 1" will decrement \fBa\fR by 1 instead of setting \fBa\fR to the

 Other implementations of \fBbc\fR allow spaces in numbers.  For example,
 "x=1 3" would assign the value 13 to the variable x.  The same statement
