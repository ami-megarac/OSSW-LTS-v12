    control.dc to pre-pend "debian." to those names.

    Changed references to source package files postinst.dc and
    postrm.dc to pre-pend "debian." to those names.

    Added dependency on clean to source and diff targets.

    Moved "make distclean" to the last action in the clean target
    to prevent a failure here from aborting the preceeding cleanup.

    control.dc to debian.control.bc
    postinst.dc to debian.postinst.bc
    postrm.dc to debian.postrm.bc

This file documents changes since maintenamce of this package
