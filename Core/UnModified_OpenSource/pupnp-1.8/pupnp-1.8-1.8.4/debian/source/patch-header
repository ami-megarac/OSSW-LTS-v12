The Debian packaging of pupnp-1.8 is maintained in git, using the
merging workflow described in dgit-maint-merge(7).  There isn't a
patch queue that can be represented as a quilt series.

A detailed breakdown of the changes is available from their canonical
representation - git commits in the packaging repository.  For
example, to see the changes made by the Debian maintainer in the first
upload of upstream version 1.2.3, you could use:

    % git clone https://git.dgit.debian.org/pupnp-1.8
    % cd pupnp-1.8
    % git log --oneline 1.2.3..debian/1.2.3-1 -- . ':!debian'

(If you have dgit, use `dgit clone pupnp-1.8`, rather than plain
`git clone`.)

A single combined diff, containing all the changes, follows.
