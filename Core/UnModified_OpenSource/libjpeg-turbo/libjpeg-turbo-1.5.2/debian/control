Description: Development files for the libjpeg-turbo JPEG library
 The libjpeg-turbo JPEG library is a library for handling JPEG files.
 .
 libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX,
 SSE2, NEON) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression
 on x86, x86-64, and ARM systems.  The libjpeg-turbo JPEG library is
 an API/ABI compatible with the IJG JPEG library.
 .
 This package contains the static library, headers and documentation.

Description: Programs for manipulating JPEG files
 This package contains programs for manipulating JPEG files from the
 libjpeg-turbo JPEG library:
  * cjpeg/djpeg: convert to/from the JPEG file format
  * rdjpgcom/wrjpgcom: read/write comments in JPEG files
  * jpegtran: lossless transformations of JPEG files
  * jpegexiforient/exifautotran: manipulate EXIF orientation tag
  * tjbench: a simple JPEG benchmarking tool
